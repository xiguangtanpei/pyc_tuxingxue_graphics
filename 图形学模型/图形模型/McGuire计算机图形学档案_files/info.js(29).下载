    description: `<p>
There are two versions of the model in this zipfile. One is a cleanup of the San Miguel
model released with the PBRT book. The other is a lower-polygon version more suitable
for real-time rendering.
</p>
<p>
This scene was originally modeled by Guillermo M. Leal Llaguno of Evolucien Visual, 
based on a hacienda that he visited in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico. 
These 2017 versions were improved by Morgan McGuire, Guedis Cardenas, and Michael Mara at Williams College
and Nicholas Hull at NVIDIA with permission from Mr. Llaguno.
</p>
<p>
We began with Guillermo's original 3DS Max file and flattened the instancing
from the original for convenience in research use. We then exported it as an
OBJ file, corrected the geometry and materials, converted materials to PNG
and integrated the alpha mattes, and constructed a low-polygon 
version.
</p>
<p>
For example, on the cover of the PBRT2 book, you can see that there
are chairs in the fountain and no legs on the tables. We fixed these
and many more problems.</p>`
