`<p>This is the Picture Gallery located on the top floor of the Hallwyl Museum in Stockholm, Sweden.
Countess Wilhelmina von Hallwyl was a keen collector of Dutch and Flemish artworks of the Golden Age.
The diversity of artists and motifs is representative of the Hallwyl House Collection of Dutch and Flemish masters. The collection constitutes a kind of encyclopedia of the Golden Age of Dutch Art.</p>

Morgan McGuire removed backfaces, rotated the orientation to match other models in the archive, reduced 
precision to 1mm (to reduce space), and aligned with axes.
