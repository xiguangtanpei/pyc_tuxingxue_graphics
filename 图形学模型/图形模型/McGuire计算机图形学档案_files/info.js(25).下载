    description:
`<p>The Power Plant Model is a complete model of an actual coal
      fired power plant. It has been released for non-commercial use
      only.  UNC distributes the model as 1,185 PLY files, presumably
      because when it was released over a decade ago systems couldn't
      manage millions of polygons as well as they do today.
      Morgan McGuire and Guedis Cardenas at Williams College merged them into a single OBJ file and
      created an appropriate MTL file.
