`      <p>
 I modeled this underground, Indiana Jones-style city as part of the 
      Vokselia Minecraft world and then exported it to OBJ format
      using Mineways (http://mineways.com).  The entire world has a CC BY 3.0
      license, which enables any use with only attribution.  The model is 
      good for global illumination tests: it is mostly white, has topologically
      complex geometry, is highly and regularly tessellated,
      and is entirely "inside" because of the surrounding mountaintop.  Placing light 
      sources at each of the triangles with a Torch
      material provides reasonable illumination.
