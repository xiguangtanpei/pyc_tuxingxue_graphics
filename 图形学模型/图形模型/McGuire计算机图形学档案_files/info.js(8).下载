      <p>The <b>Atrium</b> Sponza Palace in Dubrovnik, re-modeled by Frank
        Meinl at Crytek with inspiration from Marko Dabrovic's original.  I took
        the OBJ version exported by Meinl, computed bump maps from the
        normal maps
        using <a href="https://github.com/morgan3d/misc/tree/master/normal2bump">normal2bump.cpp</a>
        (since MTL files expect height bumps, not normals), put the
        "mask" textures into the alpha channel of the associated
        diffuse texture, cleaned up noise in the masks, corrected the material
        mapping for the octagonal vases, compressed the textures using PNGcrush,
        and removed
        the long untextured banner floating in the middle of the
        atrium that appears in the file but in none of the published
        images of the model.  The zipfile includes the banner as a separate
        object.
