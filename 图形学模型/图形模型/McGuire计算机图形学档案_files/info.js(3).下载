    description: `<p>Brian Curless and Marc Levoy created this model from multiple
        range scans of a real object using a Cyberware 3030 MS
        scanner.  Morgan McGuire converted the PLY from <a
        href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/projects/large_models/happy.html">Georgia
        Tech</a> to IFS, computed vertex normals, and then exported it
        OBJ format using G3D. The model is hole-free, but contains
        small bridges due to space carving, so its topological genus
        is larger than it appears </p>
        <p> Please see <a
        href="http://www.graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/#uses">the
        note</a> about culturally appropriate uses of this model.
