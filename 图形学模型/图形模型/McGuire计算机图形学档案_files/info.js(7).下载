`<p>A 3D model of the real Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
building 90 3rd floor conference room originally created by Anat
Grynberg and Greg Ward, circa 1991. The model was created from manual
measurements with coordinates directly typed into a text editor. It is
commonly used for global illumination experiments.  </p> <p> This
model was flipped inside-out at some point in history and appears
backwards in some papers relative to the original, with the EXIT signs
reading as if in a mirror. Kenzie Lamar at Vicarious Visions fixed the
face winding directions on all surfaces to be consistent, re-modeled
the trash cans and fire extinguisher to have reasonable normals and
joints with no interpenetration, replaced the radiator vents with a
single panel, and flipped the EXIT signs. The textures observable
(especially in the wood grain) in Ward's original rendering are
procedural and are not represented in this model.
