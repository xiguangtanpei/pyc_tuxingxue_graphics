`      <p>
 Infinite-Realities Director Lee Perry-Smith created a 3D scan of his head. 
      Morgan McGuire and Guedis Cardenas at Williams College converted the displacement file from .tif to 16-bit .png
      and created created a low resolution version of the bump map. We set up the .mtl file's
      texture maps, painted the bump map so that it is seamless at the back of the head,
      and adjusted the default glossy highlight to better simulate a 3D head.
