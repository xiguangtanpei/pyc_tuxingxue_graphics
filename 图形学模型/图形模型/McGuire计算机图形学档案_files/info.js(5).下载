    description:
`<p>Donald Greenberg and students at Cornell University created the original physical 
"Cornell Box" and matching virtual geometry. It has been used for decades as a
standard test scene in computer graphics for photorealistic rendering.
</p>
<p> 
 Guedis Cardenas, Morgan McGuire, and Michael Mara created these eight OBJ files that represent some of the most commonly
       used test scenes based on that data. These include the <a href="http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/online/box/data.html">original box</a>
       and many variations by Henrik Jensen (the icon image is by Jensen) such as a box full of water. Note that the original 
       real box is not a perfect cube, so
       the faces are correspondingly imperfect in this data set.
