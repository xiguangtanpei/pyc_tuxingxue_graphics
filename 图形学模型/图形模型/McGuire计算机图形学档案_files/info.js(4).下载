`<p>Greg Turk and Marc Levoy created this model from multiple
        range scans of a real object using a Cyberware 3030 MS
        scanner.  Morgan McGuire converted the file to OBJ, fixed holes, computed smooth vertex normals, 
        and created a texture parameterization in 3DS Max. https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~turk/bunny/bunny.html</p>`,
