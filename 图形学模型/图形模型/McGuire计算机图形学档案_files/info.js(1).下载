    description: `<p>Mike Pan created this model for a <a href="https://www.blender.org/download/demo-files/">Blender 2.7 demo</a>.
         Morgan McGuire corrected exposed backfaces, most holes, mesh interpenetration, and materials in 3DS Max and exported to OBJ
         format. The original had two cars with angled wheels. This version has a single car with wheels in a default pose that 
         for easier run-time animation.</p>`,
