 The Neu Rungholt medieval village on the Minecraft map entitled 
      "Alone in the dark" created by "kescha", who says,
      "Fell[sic] free to use the map or parts of it for you own projects. "
      I converted this to OBJ format using Mineways (http://mineways.com)
      This is a nice moderately high-polygon model because it has an extremely
      regular tessellation.
