    description:
`<p>The Atrium Sponza Palace in Dubrovnik.  Originally created for a
rendering contest and since adopted by the global illumination
community as a test model.  The original has some material problems
and its download site no longer available.
Kenzie Lamar at Vicarious Visions converted the 3DS file to OBJ
and assigned texture coordinates to the ceilings.  Morgan McGuire hand-painted
bump maps for most surfaces. Dabrovic never licensed the model himself,
but his terms appear to be consistent with CC BY-NC.
